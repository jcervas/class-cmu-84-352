## Voting Rights Poem

###### By: Gianna Amaro, Prina Doshi (*Within the context of the controversy surrounding voting numbers for 2022 Midterm elections*)

Dear Boomer Republicans

Suggestions to raise voting age

Can we get on the same page?

Proposing hindering our voting rights 

Did you not expect us to fight?

Tell us our generation doesn’t participate

And when we vote, you think we hallucinate

We defied your expectations

Now we deal with your frustrations 

Because the vote didn't go your way  

We are expected to pay 

So, next midterm or presidential election

Please don’t try to sway with your deceptions 

Fom GenZ

Nineteen twenty was the first year women in America could vote

Only after years of fighting the original constraints that our founding fathers wrote

Politicians treat voters like puppets, pulling their strings to be re-elected 

Under attack, voters must continue to fight back against voter suppression

People like me have opinions too, so why can’t my voice be heard? 

Power to the people is fundamental for a democracy, so please spread the word

Equality is what we crave, but something we have struggled to find for many centuries

This is my country, our country, and we will no longer act as puppets

So remember, a democracy without voter protections is no better than a penitentiary  


## Apathetic Epidemic

###### By: Anthony Cacciato

Verse 1:

“What’s the point?”, most people say

The results are always the same

So they go and throw their vote away

While they’ve still got skin in the game

Weeks pass on from Election Day

Your world begins to change

They’ve moved to take your rights away

For your safety in exchange

Bridge:

Right from the founding, these issues persisted

Denial of the right to make your voice heard

Whoever they don’t want are simply blacklisted

And it happens today, it’s absurd

Chorus:

An apathetic epidemic

That’s what we’re going through

The problem here ain’t systemic

It’s because of me and you

They’ve tried before, and they'll try again

To take away your right

That’s why every American

Should put up a fight

I want to vote

Even if I’m fresh off the boat 

I want to be able to choose who to lead

Even if my name is Jared and im 19 and i can’t read


Don’t worry I will pay the tax

So just go ahead and relax

I am not a criminal

I don’t want be invisible

Let’s not make this too political

I am also an individual

Losing my mind inside this one-way mirror

I don’t think I can make myself any clearer:

(Chorus) 

I wanna vote

Even if I’m fresh off the boat 

Even if my name is Jared and im 19 and i can’t read

I want to be able to choose who to lead

This country was built to get rid of the monarchy 

But nothing is perfect, not even democracy

The votes were given to property-owning white men

Didn't even think to include minorities or women

Freedom is something we seem to struggle with

We fought a whole war for it, so it can't be a myth

Representation is a right that everybody needs 

We shouldn't have to make the people ask and plead 

Once Black people were freed they still couldn't vote

Too many rules in place, the whites could still gloat

Property laws, grandfather clause, poll taxes you see 

This country was made for one person and it sure wasn't me

Not til the year 1920 could women vote

American history is nothing to sugarcoat

Men were supposed to be their representation

I think some of their opinions got lost in translation 

Freedom is something we seem to struggle with

We fought a whole war for it, so it can't be a myth

Representation is a right that everybody needs 

We shouldn't have to make the people ask and plead

Roses are red

I don’t know what to do

Republicans are Red

Democrats are Blue

Its 1826, elections are back 

I can't wait to vote, oh wait

I'm black

The south is very mean, It got me feeling blue,

Tried to move to the north but they

attacked me too

Tried to make an honest living but it might be too late 

But in the white mans eyes is a lot of hate

I need a new life; a very clean slate

I guess I’ll try again in 2008

Represent America

On the backs of our ancestor's trials and tribulations to reach the polls 

We cry...representation matters

On the fact that our country is for the people, but does not protect all its people

We cry...representation matters

On the tears of each and every failed attempt for women to walk side by side with men to the polls

We cry...representation matters

On the assimilation attempts of our indigenous population born in the US, but not deemed US citizens until 1924

We cry...representation matters

On the unfair literacy tests and poll taxes which stopped our Black brothers and sisters from being heard at the polls

We cry...representation matters

On the barriers placed against everyday people making it harder for their voices to ring free

We cry...representation matters

Rep | Pre | Sent

Rep | Pre | Sent

We cry REP-PRESENT...we cry...representation matters!

We cry for the representation of all people of The United States of America

On the day when all are represented at the polls, our victory cry will be as bold as those broad stripes and bright stars

US Electoralism caused a deep, dividing schism. Banter and debate over who can participate.

At first, only landed men had the keys to democracy. But after throwing down the crown, that felt like hypocrisy.

Then some states decided that taxpayers should be voters, those with stake in government, not a bunch of freeloaders.

Paupers were perceived as prone to Impropriety, to give them voting rights would threaten their society.

At the Constitutional convention, a matter of contention, was if national suffrage would be ratified in ink.

But states differed in opinion, and so came the decision, that national franchise would fall in the states dominion.

As for who enjoyed the right to fill out ballots that were dropping, you can leave that to the husbands cuz you know women be shopping. 

Ladies, people said, were far too delicate. For near two hundred years restrained as electoral celibates.

Faith based exemptions too, in some states, but those would widen. Which is how you get Catholics in charge like Joe Biden.

People be working these long hours

Where's the time for us to get in line

You expect us to speak our mind 

To use our voice

Like we even have a choice 

As not all of us have the right 

Despite living in this world that is considered a “delight”

Yet it is only full of spite 

America is supposed to be a democracy 

But all I see is hypocrisy:

A place that screams freedom 

As we continue to bleed them

Yet we don't really mean it

Otherwise we’d give them a permit

They’re screaming to free them 

When are we going to believe them

You say our individual votes don't matter 

Lost in the crowd like a mad hatter

But truth be told.

When the pivotal moments of your life unfold

You will continuously complain about injustice, rendering yourself insane

However you are the one at fault,

The one to blame.

###### By: Jayla Hemphill

The American rose, rooted far into the soil,

Blossomed in blood, sweat, and turmoil

From the soldier’s chants to the slave’s songs,

The rose symbolizes growth, the righting of the wrong.

Standing for Civil Rights and falling to the War,

Where the poor man waited at Heaven’s door,

For each petal that withers away,

That poor man waits, yet another day.

Soon, the ground will sprout a plain, bare stem,

And the man will be reminded, he’s yet another of “them.”

And perhaps, someday, a new rose will bloom

And perhaps, someday, it too will be doomed,

Because the beauty of the rose is a symbol of guilt,

And like that poor man’s hope, that rose will wilt

See, the rose’s petals were once a symbol of pride,

An ongoing hope for man to take in stride.

The battle’s never-ending, it’s simply a cycle

The rich will drink wine and deem that man spiteful.

They will pierce him with thorns and complain of his cries,

They will call him stupid, they will strip his rights

They will close the ballot boxes the moment night falls,

They will watch the man wither into nothing at all.

And perhaps, someday, they will open that door,

They will find no one there, at least not anymore.

Verse 1:

In the South, a battle raged on

As African Americans fought for their right to vote and be gone

From segregation and discrimination that they faced

But with courage and resilience, they won their place

Chorus:

Voting rights, what a fight

For freedom and equality, day and night

Marching, protesting, standing strong

For the right to vote, all day long

Refrain:

We won't stop until every voice is heard

Until every citizen can cast their word

For the future of this land we hold dear

Voting rights, they are finally here

Verse 2:

In the 60s, the Civil Rights Movement took flight

With leaders like MLK, who fought for what's right

They marched on Washington, "things need to be changed!"

For equal rights and voting power, wanting to not be estranged

Chorus:

Voting rights, what a fight

For freedom and equality, day and night

Marching, protesting, standing strong

For the right to vote, all day long

Refrain:

We won't stop until every voice is heard

Until every citizen can cast their word

For the future of this land we hold dear

Voting rights, they are finally here

Outro:

So let's exercise our right to vote

And make our voices heard, with every note

For a better future, for all to see

Equality and justice, finally free.


## Voting in the eyes of a traveler

###### By: Jay Lei

(Verse 1)

Voting,

This growth ring of America,

Attests to its checkered history

Of some protracted struggles

Of joy and celebration

Of tears and lamentation

I have only heard stories of pious youths.

Waiting on a bus ride

Or stuck in traffic in a car

Of an austere guy who kept flashcards

Of every member of the legislature.

(Chorus)

Then I was walking on the street,

Some volunteers approached me,

Extending their warmest solicitation

I told them I couldn’t sign up for registration.

Then in dismay, they directed away their attention.

As they realized that I am not from this nation.

That I am not a participant in this grand experimentation.

(Verse 2)

Voting has many faces and

Many faces have I seen:

They are the names on yard signs,

Witty lines on T-shirts,

stickers on laptops,

Or sheets on the bulletin board

Or the star-spangled pins and more

Like some sort of proclamation

Or that flurry of ad spam every election cycle

YouTube users around the world bought some services to avoid that trouble.

(Chorus)

Then I was walking on the street,

Some volunteers approached me,

Extending their warmest solicitation

I told them I couldn’t sign up for registration.

Then in dismay, they directed away their attention.

As they realized that I am not from this nation.

That I am not a participant in this grand experimentation.

(Coda)

What is it all about?

Many things I have heard

All great and serious

“The stakes have never been higher.”

“justice, rights, and people’s story”

“bearing the weight of history.”

They surely are important,

and they surely are ongoing

adding yet another growth ring

My voice isn’t heard; this is absurd!

You’re drunk on your powers when they should be ours.

Even though the population of the US was on the rise,

Minorities and women still couldn’t vote, which we now despise.

There were many different requirements to cast a vote;

you had to own property and prove you could read an essay that the government wrote.

The importance of voting is absolutely vital,

It is a right that most citizens should be entitled.

Even though whether or not felons should vote will forever be a debate;

however, by doing the crime, the right to vote they do eliminate.

While Mississippi tried removing Blacks from political life,

for years they fought for the right, going through numerous turmoils and strife.

If you put yourself in the shoes of Jackson,

you may not give the right to Blacks and their daughters and sons.

But if you put yourself in the shoes of Fredrick Douglass,

all you would want is equal opportunity at last.

When the democracy is lost

Home of promise and faith

We must be the lifeline

You are a democracy in motion

A riot for a nation

Will your arms sit tight?

Tomorrow has not been ruled

Will you build it?

The future is what we make it 

If we dare to vote

For liberty, for democracy

A war on drugs that nobody’s using

Passing the civil rights act and carpet bombing Vietnam 

Buying the empire of liberty and supporting slavery

Deporting families in the name of security 

Will these movements ever find some truth in them?

Our hands will turn back on your hypocrisy 

Democracy :)

WOOOOOOOO! YAHHHH!

The White to Vote

The fourteenth amendment was supposed to change this.

A war fought and won to save the union.

Enfranchise all and cease the strangeness.

Once and for all, racial cohesion.

But alas, it persists.

On racial segregation our country subsists.

Where have the rights gone

Bernie, it’s all wrong

When is our representation due?

[Refrain]

Yeah, I, I know it’s hard to change laws

The country we want to be

It’s even harder to change minds

When they don’t believe in me

You say I can’t vote in this election 

But is it too late to try?

I want my representation

Or all of our rights will be taken 

You’ve wasted my rights

I’ve fought all the fights

Now I’m suffering

Still stuck in the dark, when you called it fair

But even the government will show its mark

In 1831, two French-men came to shore,

To study democracy, discover and explore,

They were shown a country where equality reigns,

With citizens empowered, destroying chains,

From a world where aristocrats still rule,

De Tocqueville was shocked at our attitude,

Where people were equal, regardless of class,

And people could decide their own path.

The Constitution says nothing about voting,

but unless you have money or pale skin,

only the rich white men will be gloating. 

Women were too soft, 

colored people were too colored,

the Founding Fathers would have scoffed.

We hold these truths to be self evident,

though all men are created “equal,”

disenfranchisement was quite prevalent. 

Suffrage is hard to attain, 

through constitutional revisions, 

and mental strain. 

Today, we have more who can vote.

Hopefully for the future,

voting rights won’t be so cutthroat. 

Voting rights are not zero-sum. 

We can all have a voice;

better advocates we can all become.

Democracys a game, wanna play?" Ay

So it's gonna be four years 

Or it's gonna go down in flames

If not voting was worth the pain

Got a long list of contenders 

They'll tell you they’re the best

'Cause you got a blank space baby 

And you should write my name 

'Cause we're young, and we're reckless

We'll visit the ballot box

It'll give you a mandate, mm

Or an election shock

From gerrymandering to literacy tests, this country’s history is strewn

With voting rights made to be a big to do!

So long as someone has power, they will try to keep it

At times striking down voters’ power to reap it.

Some days will be better, while some will be worse,

With some seeing universal suffrage to be more of a curse. 

But let’s hope the worst of history is behind us

With more out to vote being a future to guide us!

Today we teach our children that everyone is equal under the Law

But before the 19th amendment 

That is not what women 

Experienced or saw.

Back then women had little power over their lives and could not vote 

The reasons for this 

Seem unimaginable 

But this is what men in power said and wrote 

That women were childlike, inferior,  incapable of independent thought 

And only white men had the right that the women’s movement so desperately sought. 

So women rallied and faced so much lashback and stress 

knowing that voting would ensure women's social and economic progress. 

African Americans had it worse facing voter suppression, poll taxes, literacy tests and even morality clause 

They tried so hard to to keep their voices unheard 

by making up these ignorant, unfair laws. 

So our foremothers fought and marched for our right 

I call on my sisters 

Never forget 

We must mobilize and carry on with the fight 

For equality 

The struggle continues 

To this very day 

For women’s voices 

To have their rightful say

_(poem, can be interpreted as written from someone who's right to vote was not given immediately, and was a long and grueling process.. for instance a woman at the beginning of the 20th century, before the 19th Amendment)_

How can I be patriotic in a country where my voice is left unheard?

This concept to me is quite absurd.

The conditions limiting my right to vote can so easily be observed!

However, I lie here watching the political tide shifting in our favor slowly.

When will I finally be a citizen wholly?

They say that everyone's got a vote,

but it's not as simple as it sounds, 

across the states the legislators wrote,

women will have to wait till the next round.

For centuries the color of your skin blocked your vote,

40 acres and a mule,

but that didn't come with a vote,

you might say that that's just plain cruel. 

Now they might say that you have a vote, 

but seems you can't pass a literacy test, 

or if your grandfather couldn't vote, 

then you'll just have to hope for the best. 

But that's just history, now everyone has a vote, 

although they'll gerrymander so your party can't win, 

or maybe you don't have the right ID for the vote, 

or maybe you can't leave work to the booth, even for a min. 

They say that everyone's got a vote,

but it's not as simple as it sounds, 

maybe you can pass your legislator a note,

## Treasure your vote

###### By: Matthew Visco, Kevin Wang

Treasure your vote

In New Jersey they take it (from 1790 to 1807)

In North Korea they fake it

Can I get a fair shake

A choice

A voice

For change

No stamp

No vote

I can swear I remember we fought a war over that

What happened?

The lines are too long

The rent is too high

All these candidates are wrong

Go and vote! Why would I?

One person: One vote?

I don’t think that’s true

Someone in Wyoming

Has more representation than you

Nonetheless

People suffered for suffrage 

Poor White Men till 1828

Women in 1920

Blacks till 1965

Even today!

Wars, trials, tribulations

So get off the couch

And get to the polling station

It’s the least you can do

For this great nation

Barred from his dreams and paid pennies

From 1790 to 1807, New Jersey gave that right

Until it was stolen, without a fight,

But to earn it back,

We had to strike

Until it was returned, in 1920
