## Democracy in trouble?

- A majority (52%) of young Americans believe that our democracy is either “in trouble,” or “failing”[^1]
- On American Exceptionalism, less than one-third believe that "America is the greatest country in the world"
- Young Americans place the chances that they will see a second civil war in their lifetime at 35%; chances that at least one state secedes at 25%
  + Nearly half (46%) of young Republicans place the chances of a second civil war at 50% or higher, compared to 32% of Democrats

## Assuming Democracy is good...

**Assuming democracy is good**:

- How much and what kind of democracy should we have?

  + Should we have direct democracy where everyone votes on the internet?
  
  + Should this happen for all levels of government, from city issues to federal issues?
  
  + What offices should be elected, and which appointed?
  
  + Who should appoint, and who should confirm? Can the public recall?
  
## Criteria for a Model Electoral Democracy
- "In every democratic country a substantial gap exists between actual and ideal democracy. That gap offers us a challenge: can we find ways to make ‘democratic’ countries more democratic?"[^2]
