TOWARDS UNIVERSAL SUFFRAGE -- AND BEYOND
THE QUIET YEARS
CHAPTER 7
TO BE ADDED
Racial Tensions
The South was a cauldron of racial tension in the 1950s
African Americans pressed forward against the boundaries of America's caste system, demanding an end to social segregation and second-class citizenship
Fighting for Rights
Black citizens marched, rallied, boycotted buses, wrote petitions, and filed lawsuits to challenge the Jim Crow laws that had kept them in their place for more than half a century
The widespread resistance to integration only underscored the Black community's need for political rights, but throughout the 1950s their efforts to vote were thwarted more often than not
Politics of the 1950s
Liberal Democrats in Congress were eager to take action–at least to implement the recommendations of Truman's Commission on Civil Rights–but their influence was offset by the power of southern Democrats
Republicans were similarly torn: while the desire to court Black voters reinforced the party's traditional pro–civil rights principles, many Republicans also hoped to make inroads into the solid South by winning over white southern voters
Civil Rights Act 1957
The first civil rights bill passed by Congress in more than eighty years
It was a modest piece of legislation, so modest that it was roundly criticized by African-American activists
The bill created a national Civil Rights Commission, elevated the Civil Rights section into a full-fledged division of the Justice Department, and authorized the attorney general to seek injunctions and file civil suits in voting rights cases
Ineffectual legislation
Well-intentioned as the bill surely was, it had few teeth and little impact
The Justice Department was sluggish in initiating suits, southern federal judges were sometimes unreceptive, and the entire strategy of relying on litigation inescapably meant that progress would be slow
The ineffectiveness of the bill led to the passage in 1960 of a second Civil Rights Act, stronger than the first, but conceptually similar and still modest in its reach
Political Temperature
The Civil Rights Acts of 1957 and 1960 were bipartisan compromises constructed to appease competing political interests, but it was apparent that difficult choices loomed on the horizon
The political temperature was soaring in the South
The growing militancy of the Black freedom movement only stiffened the opposition
The Fight
The governors of Alabama and Mississippi refused to desegregate their universities
Voting districts were gerrymandered to dilute the influence of Blacks who did manage to register
Freedom riders were beaten and their buses burned
Police arrested protestors by the thousands
Bombs were tossed into Black churches
Activists were occasionally murdered in cold blood
XXIV Amendment
Twenty-fourth Amendment was ratified with relatively little opposition; and Black registration in the South rose to more than 40 percent by 1964
Section 1:  __The right of citizens of the United States to vote in any primary or other election for President or Vice President for electors for President or Vice President, or for Senator or Representative in Congress, shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax__
Section 2:  __The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation__
Civil Rights Act 1964
Conflict in the South continued
The Kennedy administration in 1963 drafted an omnibus civil rights bill designed to give strong federal support to equal rights, although it said little about voting rights per se
Pres. Kennedy did not live to witness the passage of his civil rights bill, but his successor, Lyndon Johnson, seized the moment after Kennedy's assassination to obtain the bill's passage as a tribute to the late president
Voting Rights Act
Johnson himself was elected to the presidency in 1964 with an enormous popular vote, offering the first southern president in a century the opportunity to complete the Second Reconstruction
He was personally sympathetic to the cause of Black suffrage, bidding for a place in history, and prodded by the nationally televised spectacle of police beatings and arrests of peaceful, prosuffrage marchers in Selma, Alabama
Pressing for change
Johnson went to Congress in March 1965 to urge passage of a national Voting Rights Act.
"The outraged conscience of a nation" demanded action, "It is wrong–deadly wrong–to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote." "it is really all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we  _shall _ overcome." he told a joint session of Congress.
New Constituency
Johnson's words, spoken to a television audience of seventy million and to a somber, hushed Congress that interrupted him forty times with applause, were sincere, principled, and moving
The president also knew that the Democrats' political balancing act was over: with the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  __the party had decisively tilted away from the white South and toward Black voters__ , and now it was going to need as many Black voters as possible to have a chance of winning southern states
The Voting Rights Act
Designed as a temporary, quasi>- emergency measure, the act possessed an automatic "trigger" that immediately suspended literacy tests and other "devices" (including so-called good character requirements and the need for prospective registrants to have someone vouch for them) in states and counties where fewer than 50 percent of all adults had gone to the polls in 1964; the suspensions would remain in force for five years
The act authorized the attorney general to send federal examiners into the South to enroll voters and observe registration practices
Section 5
To prevent the implementation of new discriminatory laws, section 5 of the act prohibited the governments of all affected areas from changing their electoral procedures without the approval (or "preclearance") of the civil rights division of the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington
States could bring an end to federal supervision only by demonstrating to the federal court that they had not utilized any discriminatory devices for a period of five years
Passing the law
The Voting Rights Act was passed by an overwhelming majority, as moderate Republicans joined with Democrats to carry out what Johnson called the "tumbling" of "the last of the legal barriers" to voting
Some conservative Republicans and southern Democrats voted negatively, but recognizing the inevitability of the bill's triumph and the political wisdom of supporting it, forty southern congressmen voted favorably
Immediate impact
The legislation had an immediate impact
In Mississippi, Black registration went from  _less than 10 percent_  in 1964 to almost  _60 percent_  in 1968; in Alabama, the figure rose from  _24 percent _ to  _57 percent _
In the region as a whole,  __roughly a million new voters were registered__  within a few years after the bill became law, bringing African-American registration to a record 62 percent
Milestone law
The essence of the act was simply an effort to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment, which had been law for almost a century
Racial barriers to political participation had been a fundamental feature of American life, and resistance to racial equality was deeply ingrained; so too was resistance to federal intervention into the prerogatives of the states
__Why did the country finally overcome its obstacles to pass the VRA?__
Renewing the VRA
>- In 1970, despite significant reluctance in the Nixon administration and congressional jockeying to weaken the measure, the bill was renewed for five years
>	+ the ban on literacy tests was extended to all states
>- In 1975, the act was extended for an additional seven years, and its reach enlarged to cover "language minorities," including Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, and Asian American
>- In 1982, despite the Reagan administration's anti-civil rights posture, the act's core provisions were extended for an additional twenty-five years
>- Reauthorized on a unanimous Senate vote and a 390-33 House vote in 2006 for 25 more years
Transformation of Politics
The debates surrounding these renewals–and they were substantial–were grounded in a new partisan configuration that in part was a consequence of the Voting Rights Act itself
By the late 1960s, all southern states contained a large bloc of Black voters whose loyalty to the Democratic Party had been cemented by the events of the Kennedy and Johnson years
Since these voters constituted a core Democratic constituency, Democratic politicians, even within the South, generally supported efforts to shore up Black political rights
At the same time, conservative white Southerners, joined by some migrants into the region, flocked to the Republican Party, reviving its fortunes in the South and becoming a critical conservative force in the national party.
VRA in the Courts
>- _South Carolina v. Katzenbach_  (1966)>	+ Voting Rights Act "are a valid means for carrying out the commands of the Fifteenth Amendment."
>- By the end of the 1960s, thus, two precepts had been clearly and irretrievably etched into federal law
>	+ The first was that  __racial barriers to the exercise of the franchise, whether simple or sophisticated, direct or indirect, were illegal__
>	+ The second was that  __Congress, backed by the courts, possessed the authority to take vigorous, even extraordinary, measures to dismantle any such racial barriers __
Warren Court
The Warren Court came to see itself as the guardian of formal democratic rights, and it fashioned the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment into a formidable weapon with which to protect the ability of citizens to participate in democratic processes
There was always conflict about the breadth of the franchise and that those  _who possessed it _ could not necessarily be counted on to extend the right to others
Faced with this reality, it made sense for an insulated institution such as the Court to defend what it believed to be a  __fundamental element of American politics __
Strict Scrutiny
Any "statutes which deny some residents the right to vote" had to come under the "strict scrutiny" of the Court  _Kramer v. Union Free School District _ (1969)
"statutes distributing the franchise constitute the foundation of our representative society."
Strict scrutiny meant that any restriction on the franchise had to be "necessary to promote a compelling state interest."
Ending Literacy Tests
Court previously held that literacy tests were constitutional as long as they were not administered in a racially discriminatory fashion.
In  _Gaston County, N.C. v. United States_  (1969), the Court ruled that literacy tests were unacceptable in locales where schools had been segregated
_Oregon v. Mitchell _ (1970) Blacks, as well as Native Americans and other minorities, received unequal and inferior educations in many locales in and out of the South, and this bias in educational opportunities hindered their ability to pass literacy tests
High rates of interstate migration, moreover, meant that literacy tests administered in states such as Arizona and New York could have the effect of disfranchising African Americans trained in segregated southern schools
Residency Requirements
The federal government's first effort to remove yet another obstacle to enfranchisement: lengthy residency requirements
Although some states had shortened their requirements, one year was still the norm
The impact of these laws according to one estimate, they kept fifteen million people from voting in the 1964 elections
With little fanfare or controversy, the 1970 VRA renewal prohibited the states from imposing more than  __a thirty-day residency requirement in presidential elections__ ; at the same time, it mandated that those who had  _relocated less than thirty days prior to an election could cast absentee ballots in their previous place of residence _
"If young men are to be drafted at eighteen years of age to fight for their Government they ought to be entitled to vote at eighteen years of age for the kind of government for which they are best satisfied to fight."
Senator Arthur Vandenberg
Age to vote
Since the nation's founding, a voting age of twenty-one–a carryover from colonial and English precedents–had been a remarkable constant in state laws governing the franchise
Polling data indicated that most Americans favored a reduction in the voting age (support rose dramatically between 1939 and 1952)
Vietnam War
The unpopularity of the Vietnam war spawned a widespread draft resistance movement, mass protests by college students, and an alarming radicalization of the young
In the political climate of the mid>- and late 1960s, the issue of eighteen-, nineteen-, and twenty-year-olds voting acquired an unprecedented urgency
Their lack of enfranchisement served, rhetorically at least, to  __underscore the absence of democratic support for the war __ and to legitimize resistance to the draft
Slipping in the change
The  _New York Times _ endorsed an age reduction on the grounds that " _young people . . . are far better prepared educationally for the voting privilege than the bulk of the nation's voters have been through much of its history_ "
In the spring of 1970, with little advance notice, legislators added a proposal for reducing the voting age, in all elections, to the amendments being prepared to the Voting Rights Act
Two-tiered rules
In  _Oregon v. Mitchell_ , the court ruled that Congress could legislate the age for federal elections, but not state elections
The prospect of a two-tiered age limit was an administrative and logistical nightmare for state election officials
Faced with this crisis, Congress moved expeditiously to rectify the mess that it had helped to create
Amendment XXVI
Senator Jennings Randolph introduced a proposal for a constitutional amendment that barred the United States or any state from denying or abridging the right to vote of any citizen aged eighteen or over on account of age
In March 1971, the Senate, with no dissenting votes, approved the amendment
Within a few weeks, the House had done the same, with negative votes cast by only nineteen members, mostly conservative Republicans or southern Democrats
State legislatures then rushed to ratify the amendment
By the end of June, thirty-eight states had done so, and the Twenty-sixth Amendment was law
__The ratification process was by far the most rapid in the history of the republic __
National Franchise
What occurred in the course of a decade was not only the re-enfranchisement of African Americans but the abolition of nearly all remaining limits on the right to vote
The total number of new voters added to the electorate cannot be counted with precision, but the figure was surely in excess of twenty million
__The Voting Rights Acts, coupled with a succession of Supreme Court decisions, effectively brought to a close the era of state control over suffrage__
National voting rights
The political leaders of the 1960s found themselves thinking through the issue of voting rights in a manner unparalleled since Reconstruction
If the polity was going to be democratized, it would require action by the national government, in the name of the nation's publicly professed values
Equal Protection
Court's discovery of the  __applicability of the equal protection clause __ to voting rights represented the Court's own embrace of the internal logic of suffrage reform
If discriminating against Blacks was wrong–and it was clearly proscribed by the Fifteenth Amendment–so too was discriminating against the  _very poor_ , the  _propertyless_ , the  _mobile_ , and the  _Spanish-speaking _
The Court's use of the equal protection clause was a means of extending the ban on racially-grounded disenfranchisement stated explicitly in the Fifteenth Amendment to  _other forms of discriminatory disfranchisement_  not expressly mentioned in the Constitution
DC voting rights
Residents of the capital remained unsuccessful in their attempts to gain voting representation in Congress
__They had been granted electoral votes in presidential elections in 1961, thanks to the Twenty-third Amendment to the Constitution __
In 1978, a constitutional amendment was approved by Congress that would have granted Washington two senators as well as voting representatives in the House
Conservatives around the nation (and particularly in the South) opposed the measure; when the seven-year window for ratification closed in 1985, the D.C. Voting Rights Amendment had been endorsed by only sixteen of the needed thirty-eight states
_What rights should residents of DC have in terms of voting & representation?_
