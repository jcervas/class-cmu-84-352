\subsection{Description/Objective:}\label{descriptionobjective}}

Democracy in the United States is looking a bit rickety. Decades of
progress in voting rights are countered by recent efforts to weaken the
connection between popular opinion and representational outcomes. This
course will address a board set of topics relating to representation,
including redistricting, the process of redrawing legislative and
congressional lines, which every state will do in 2021. Redistricting
can remedy a distorted Census count - or make its effects tenfold worse.
We will address how lines can be drawn to enhance fairness and the
representation of diverse communities. We will also spend time on the
concept of `one person, one vote', the Electoral College, the structure
of federalism (vertical representation) and checks and balances in the
branches of government (horizonal representation). Special attention
will be given to access to the franchise, both in the historical context
modern voting rights.

\hypertarget{key-topics}{%
\subsection{Key Topics:}\label{key-topics}}

The electoral connection, the Voting Rights Act, formal, substantive,
descriptive, and symbolic representation, gerrymandering, `One person,
one vote', policy congruence

\hypertarget{course-relevance}{%
\subsection{Course Relevance:}\label{course-relevance}}

Representation is fundamental to modern government. Understanding how
governments respond to public opinion, electoral outcomes, and public
sentiment more broadly is key to understanding how republics maintain
credibility. Though this class will most squarely focus on the United
States, other democratic institutional arrangements will be used for
comparison. Recent anti-majoritarian outcomes in the United States have
led scholars and the public generally to question the electoral link.
One particularly crucial aspect of this is in the manipulation of
legislative districts, better known as gerrymandering. We will spend
several weeks on the provisions of the U.S. Constitution that require
the redrawing of legislative districts every decade, including just
recently after the 2020 census. Beyond simply learning about this
process, we will draw districts using geographic information systems
software. The work product produced in this course can be delivered to
state and local governments as public input into the redistricting
process. Multiple tracks will be offered for those more interested in
the computer science, mathematics, legal, or geographic aspects of
redistricting.

\hypertarget{summary}{%
\subsection{Summary:}\label{summary}}

In this course, we will explore the concept of representation. There are
three major aspects of representation we will explore: 1) voting rights,
2) electoral democracy and representation, 3) formal representation
(i.e., redistricting). The principal focus will be on addressing these
topics in the context of American politics. But democracy and
representation are universal values and insights from other systems may
be incorporated.

We will explore the theoretical underpinnings of representation from a
democratic norms' perspective, the legal and constitutional nature of
U.S. institutions. We will spend several weeks reviewing the history of
voting rights in America. Legislative elections in the US are held in
single-member districts, which require the drawing of district
boundaries every decade. Several weeks of the course will be devoted to
understanding this process. We will learn to draw legally compliant
electoral maps. We will also explore the possibility to create
manipulated districting schemes that can lead to partisan or racial
advantages. Moreover, we will learn to identify features of
redistricting plans that exhibit these biases.

\hypertarget{prerequisite-knowledge}{%
\subsection{Prerequisite Knowledge:}\label{prerequisite-knowledge}}

None required. This course will begin with the most basic understanding
of democratic processes and attempt to ``build the puzzle'' of the
complex systems that make up our representative democracy. It will be
helpful to be comfortable working with probability and statistics.
Redistricting will be done on laptop computer running Dave's
Redistricting App. Computer programming is optional.

\hypertarget{learning-objectives}{%
\subsection{Learning Objectives:}\label{learning-objectives}}

Students will learn to use concepts from law, political science, math,
sociology, and computer science to understand the political world as it
relates to voting and elections. They will be able to identify the
strengths and weaknesses of different electoral systems with respect to
representation and policy outcomes. They will be able to connect voting
rights to groups' experiences and opportunities. Students will explore
what voting rights mean to different communities, how these differences
help inform us about needed areas of improvement, and how institutional
design affects incentive structures. This includes how institutions can
create disadvantages for minority groups when decisions are made by
majority rule. Given the differences in voting rules, students will be
able to show how the choice of electoral system can overcome structural
discrimination against minority groups.

Students will learn about the US Census and decennial reapportionment.
They will develop the necessary skills to design legally compliant
political districting maps. They will explore how legislative district
lines can differentially affect groups, potentially leading to reduced
representation, especially for marginalized groups. Students will learn
how to analyze maps using common data techniques. They will be exposed
to advanced techniques from computer science and mathematics. Students
will create a plan for reducing inequality in voting rights and a more
equitable society.

By the end of the course, students will be able to use methods from
their own discipline to identify and improve on deficiencies in voting
systems and use methods from other disciplines that can enhance
approaches to solving problems of democracy.

In general, submitting assignments on time lets me provide feedback in a
more timely and efficient manner. Assignments build on each other, so
timely submissions are crucial to your progress in the class. However,
sometimes life happens. If you cannot submit an assignment on time, the
default will be that you will be eligible for 90\% of the grade the
first 48 hours that the assignment is late. If you must submit beyond 48
hours past the due date, please contact me
\href{mailto:cervas@cmu.edu}{\nolinkurl{cervas@cmu.edu}} as soon as
possible so we can plan.

\subsubsection{In-class exercises:}\label{in-class-exercises}}

Throughout the semester, we will have several in-class exercises. These
are short, creative-type assignments designed to support your other
assignments and to provoke thoughtful evaluations of our democracy. You
will be able to collaborate in teams, but each student must submit
individually. You will begin these in class and will have until the
following day at midnight to submit on Canvas.

\hypertarget{plan-comparison}{%
\subsubsection{Plan Comparison:}\label{plan-comparison}}

You will compare several alternative plans for Ohio US Congressional
Districts that were proposed for the 2021 round of redistricting. You
will find at least two plans and compare them to the map adopted by the
OH legislature (which is illegal after 2022). You should compare it on
measure of traditional criteria, and on measures of partisan and racial
equity. A very short write-up should accompany your comparisons, not to
exceed two pages single-spaced. In addition to the write-up, you should
prepare maps (screenshots or otherwise), tables, and any other visuals
to enhance your writeup.

\hypertarget{redistricting-plan}{%
\subsubsection{Redistricting Plan:}\label{redistricting-plan}}

You will create a Congressional plan for US House in Ohio. Each plan
should consist of 15 districts. The plan should be fair, as you
understand fair. You should then write-up your conclusions about this
plan, and why it is fair. This should not exceed one-single-spaced pages
and should also include maps and tables (not included in the max page
count). You may describe any communities of interests you have preserved
in your text.

\hypertarget{expert-witness-report}{%
\subsubsection{Expert Witness Report:}\label{expert-witness-report}}

Using the two prior assignments, you will construct a report analyzing
the illegal Congressional districting plan used in the 2022 election in
Ohio. You will be writing as if you were hired by either the plaintiffs
or the defendants in response to the Ohio congressional plan. You will
evaluate the plan in comparison to your plan (``YOUR-LAST-NAME
illustrative plan''), and the other two alternative plans you have
analyzed. In your write up, you will describe why the plan should be
determined to be legal or illegal (your choice). You can use reports
that I have written in this capacity as a guide for your own report. It
should be at least 3 and not to exceed 6 single-spaced pages (excluding
tables and maps, which you should include). You should also put links to
each of the plan's DRA page so that the reader can access the plans. You
should briefly describe the legal requirements for a redistricting plan
in Ohio, include state and federal statutory law. You may work with at
most 3 other people as a group on this report. If you do this, then you
should use maps created by each member in the comparison, and the page
length can be at most 10 single-spaced pages to accommodate the extra
plans.

\hypertarget{course-structure}{%
\subsection{Course Structure:}\label{course-structure}}

This provides an outline of the course, including topics and a reading
schedule. Topics are subject to change (1) because of the virtual nature
of the course and (2) democracy often gives us more urgent topics to
address. This is not a history course, and we are living in a time when
redistricting will be taking place. That said, I will spend a few weeks
talking about the history of voting rights in America and how that
informs our understanding of contemporary rights.

\emph{Parliament is not a congress of ambassadors from different and
hostile interests; which interests each must maintain, as an agent and
advocate, against other agents and advocates; but parliament is a
deliberative assembly of one nation, with one interest, that of the
whole; where, not local purposes, not local prejudices, ought to guide,
but the general good, resulting from the general reason of the whole.
You choose a member indeed; but when you have chosen him, he is not
member of Bristol, but he is a member of parliament. If the local
constituent should have an interest, or should form an hasty opinion,
evidently opposite to the real good of the rest of the community, the
member for that place ought to be as far, as any other, from any
endeavour to give it effect.} -- Edmund Burke

\subsubsection{ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:}\label{academic-integrity}}

Academic Integrity is a core CMU value, and as a member of the CMU
community, it is important that the work you turn in for this class is
wholly your own. As your instructor, I will strive to ensure that you
develop the necessary knowledge and skills to meet the learning
objectives for this class, just as it is your task to put in the effort
to complete the work and ask for help if you need it. In this
hybrid/remote environment for Spring 2021, you might have questions
about what is and is not acceptable. I do not like when politicians
steal power from some voters, and likewise I do not like when students
steal other's intellectual property. Do not do it, it is not worth it. I
have created a course that everyone can be, and should be, successful
in.

As a reminder all students should follow CMU's Academic Integrity
Policy.

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the
Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your
accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I
will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as
appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would
benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office
of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at

As a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can

lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may
diminish your academic performance and/or reduce your ability to
participate in daily activities. CMU services are available, and
treatment does work. You can learn more about confidential mental health
services available on campus at: \url{http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/}.

Services: 412-268-2922

\hypertarget{diversity-statement}{%
\subsubsection{DIVERSITY STATEMENT:}\label{diversity-statement}}

It is my goal to create an inclusive and equitable learning environment

respected, and valued as a resource and strength. I will strive to
address the learning needs of all students, both in and out of class,
and will incorporate materials and activities that are respectful of
diversity in terms of gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic
status, ethnicity, race, and culture. I welcome and encourage feedback
on ways to improve the course for all students, and am happy to
accommodate any religious observances that may conflict with class
meetings.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\subparagraph{Introduction:}\label{introduction}}

AI is a powerful tool that can be used to enhance the learning
experience for students. However, it is important to approach the use of
AI with a positive attitude and a respect for its capabilities and
limitations. This policy outlines the guidelines for using AI in the
classroom, with a focus on creating a positive and inclusive environment
for all students.

\hypertarget{guidelines-for-using-ai-in-the-classroom}{%
\subparagraph{Guidelines for using AI in the
classroom:}\label{guidelines-for-using-ai-in-the-classroom}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  AI should be used to supplement, not replace, human interaction and
  instruction.
\item
  Students should be made aware of the limitations of AI, and encouraged
  to question and critically evaluate the information provided by AI
  systems.
\item
  AI should be used in a way that is inclusive and respectful of all
  students, regardless of their background or abilities.
\item
  AI should be used to enhance the learning experience, not to create
  additional barriers or challenges for students.
\item
  AI should be used to promote collaboration and teamwork among
  students.
\item
  Students should be encouraged to use AI in a responsible and ethical
  manner.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{responsibilities-of-instructors}{%
\subparagraph{Responsibilities of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Instructors are responsible for ensuring that AI is used in a way that
  is consistent with this policy.
\item
  Instructors should be familiar with the capabilities and limitations
  of the AI systems they are using in the classroom.
\item
  Instructors should provide students with appropriate guidance and
  support when using AI in the classroom.
\item
  Instructors should be responsive to any concerns or issues that
  students may have regarding the use of AI in the classroom.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{responsibilities-of-students}{%

  this policy.
\item
  Students should be familiar with the capabilities and limitations of
  the AI systems they are using in the classroom.
\item
  Students should use AI in a responsible and ethical manner.
\item
  Students should seek assistance from instructors if they have any
  concerns or issues regarding the use of AI in the classroom.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\subparagraph{Conclusion:}\label{conclusion}}

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that the use of AI in the
classroom is a positive and inclusive experience for all students. We
believe that AI can be a powerful tool for enhancing the learning
experience, but it is important to approach it with a positive attitude
and a respect for its capabilities and limitations. Together, we can
create a classroom environment that is both engaging and respectful of
all students.

Like American democracy itself, this syllabus is subject to amendment.
The process of amendment is as follows: (1) all students and the
professor get one vote; (2) a simple majority of voters agree to a
change; (2) a student's vote is weighted as 1/n where n=number of
students and a professor has a vote weighted as n+1. All amendments will
be announced publicly and no student shall be injured by changes. You
might notice that this clause creates uneven voting power. Basically,
I'm a dictator; but I am benevolent, and I want you to succeed, so I
will listen to all requests.
